    <p class="hd"><strong>I recieved a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned<br>were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I<br>honestly feel I got every penny's worth.</strong></p>
    <p class="quote" >" I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a<br>transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for <br>
    the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.The next 12<br>weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've<br>successfully switched
    careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. "</p>

    <p class="hhd"><strong>Such a life-changing<br>experience. Highly<br>recommended!</strong></p>
    <p class="quote">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve<br>never written a line of code. I needed <br>some structure from professionals.<br>
         who can help me learn programming<br>step by step. I was encouraged to<br>enroll by a former student of theirs<br>
        who can only say wonderful things<br>about the program. The entire<br>curriculum and staff did not<br>disappoint. They were very hands-on<br>
        and I never had to wait long for<br>assistance. The agile team project, in<br>particular, was outstanding. It took<br>my learning to the next level ina way<br>
        that no tutorial could ever have. In<br>fact, I’ve often referred to it during<br>interviews as an example of my<br>developent experience. It certainly<br>
        helped me land a job as a full-stack<br>developer after receiving multiple<br>offers. 100% recommend! ”</p>
